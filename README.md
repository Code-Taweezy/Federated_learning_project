Before you get started: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
1) Network Tpology Graph
  - Red nodes = malicious nodes 
  - Blue nodes - Honest nodes 
  - shows which nodes are connected 
2) Accuracy Over rounds 
- Green line = honest nodes accuracy 
- Red line = malicious nodes accuracy 
- Good algorithms should have a large gap between lines 
3) Acceptance Rates 
- Shouws how often each node's updates are accepted 
- Malicious nodes should, ideally, have lower acceptance rates
